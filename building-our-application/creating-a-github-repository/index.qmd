title: "Creating a GitHub repository"

Based on "Fully Automated npm publish using GitHub Actions and Semantic Release" at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZdY4XYbqLI

Previously we have created a new ReactJS component called **foo-component**.

The **.github** directory was also created. 

Now we'll make sure we have a repository on GitHub (for convenience, but mandatory, named the same: **foo-component**).
