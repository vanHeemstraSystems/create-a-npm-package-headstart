title: "Creating a GitHub repository"

Based on "Fully Automated npm publish using GitHub Actions and Semantic Release" at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZdY4XYbqLI

Previously we have created a new ReactJS component called **foo-component**.

The **.github** directory was also created. 

Now we'll make sure we have a repository on GitHub (for convenience, but mandatory, named the same: **foo-component**).

We do **not** have to created a ```README.md``` or ```LICENSE``` file as these have already been created when creating the ReactJS component.

Now inside the new directory in Visual Studio Code, remove the ```.github``` directory with all content. Next, run this command:

``` {.sh}
$ git init
```

The above command will initialize a new ```.github``` directory for you.

Continue by adding all files and directories to git by typing:

``` {.sh)
$ git add .
```

And finally, run:

``` {.sh}
$ git commit -m "Initial commit"
```
