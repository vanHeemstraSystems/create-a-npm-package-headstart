title: "Creating a ReactJS Component"
---

Based on "Create and Publish packages to npm - React Component Library using tsdx" at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVFasPXkyRE

In your terminal create a new ReactJS Component (here: foo-component):

``` {.javascript code-line-numbers="true"}
$ npx tsdx create foo-component
```

If you get prompeted as follows:

```
Need to install the following packages:
  tsdx@0.14.1
Ok to proceed? (y)
```

Agree by choosing: *y* for yes

Next, when being given the choice below:

```
? Choose a template ... 
  basic
  react
> react-with-storybook  
```

We choose **react-with-storybook** this time, so we can develop our ReactJS application making use of Storybook. Hence, move the sideways caret (```>```) in front of **react-with-storybook** and confirm your choice by hitting the Enter key.
