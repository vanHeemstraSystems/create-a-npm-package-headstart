title: "Creating a ReactJS Component"
---

Based on "Create and Publish packages to npm - React Component Library using tsdx" at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVFasPXkyRE

In your terminal create a new ReactJS Component (here: foo-component):

``` {.sh}
$ npx tsdx create foo-component
```

If you get prompted as follows:

``` {.sh}
Need to install the following packages:
  tsdx@0.14.1
Ok to proceed? (y)
```

Agree by choosing: *y* for yes

Next, when being given the choice below:

``` {.sh}
? Choose a template ... 
  basic
  react
> react-with-storybook  
```

We choose **react-with-storybook** this time, so we can develop our ReactJS application making use of Storybook. Hence, move the sideways caret (```>```) in front of **react-with-storybook** and confirm your choice by hitting the Enter key.

``` {.sh}
√ Choose a template · react-with-storybook
? Who is the package author? »  
```

As the package owner state the unique domain-name (here: **vanheemstrasystems**) to which the new to be created component belongs to guarantee it won't be colliding with a component that has been created by some other creator.

``` {.sh}
√ Who is the package author? · vanheemstrasystems
√ Created foo-component
√ Installed dependencies

  Awesome! You're now ready to start coding.

  I already ran yarn install for you, so your next steps are:
    cd foo-component

  To start developing (rebuilds on changes):
    yarn start

  To build for production:
    yarn build

  To test your library with Jest:
    yarn test

  Questions? Feedback? Please let me know!

/*
Test markup:
``` {.javascript code-line-numbers="true"}
var foo;
var bar;
```
*/

Now we have created the skeleton of the new ReactJS component, called **foo-component**!
