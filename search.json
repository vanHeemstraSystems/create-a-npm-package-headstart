    "text": "Fully automated release!!! semantic-release automates the whole package release workflow including: determining the next version number, generating the release notes and publishing the package.\nThis removes the immediate connection between human emotions and version numbers, strictly following the Semantic Versioning specification.\nsemantic-release is meant to be executed on the CI environment after every successful build on the release branch. This way no human is directly involved in the release process and the releases are guaranteed to be unromantic and unsentimental.\nGitHub Actions makes it easy to automate all your software workflows, now with world-class CI/CD. Build, test, and deploy your code right from GitHub."
