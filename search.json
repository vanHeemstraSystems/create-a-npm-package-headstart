From the Continuous Integration workflows choose the workflow called NodeJS: Build and test a Node.js project with npm. and click on “configure”.\nStick with the default name that is given to the Yaml file, here: node.js.yml\nNext, lets look inside of the newly created Action:\n# This workflow will do a clean installation of node dependencies, cache/restore them, build the source code and run tests across different versions of node\n# For more information see: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/automating-builds-and-tests/building-and-testing-nodejs\n\nname: Node.js CI\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches: [ \"main\" ]\n  pull_request:\n    branches: [ \"main\" ]\n\njobs:\n...\n.github/workflows/node.js.yml\nThen on push to the branch main all of the underneath jobs will run at the same time. Equally, if there is a pull request from any branch into main that request will run all of those jobs as well.\nNext is jobs.\n...\njobs:\n  build:\n\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n\n    strategy:\n      matrix:\n        node-version: [14.x, 16.x, 18.x]\n        # See supported Node.js release schedule at https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/\n\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n    - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}\n      uses: actions/setup-node@v3\n      with:\n        node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}\n        cache: 'npm'\n    - run: npm ci\n    - run: npm run build --if-present\n    - run: npm test\n...\n.github/workflows/node.js.yml\nThe build currently runs only on ubuntu the latest version.

    "text": "Fully automated release!!! semantic-release automates the whole package release workflow including: determining the next version number, generating the release notes and publishing the package.\nThis removes the immediate connection between human emotions and version numbers, strictly following the Semantic Versioning specification.\nsemantic-release is meant to be executed on the CI environment after every successful build on the release branch. This way no human is directly involved in the release process and the releases are guaranteed to be unromantic and unsentimental.\nGitHub Actions makes it easy to automate all your software workflows, now with world-class CI/CD. Build, test, and deploy your code right from GitHub.\nHere we’ll show how we can publish our packages automatically to npm every time someone does a git commit into our main branch. For that we are going to use github actions and semantic release. If you have never heard about semantic release, it will look into all the commit messages we did since the last time we publish to npm, try to understand from all those messages what is the next version that we should publish and then go ahead and do the publish for us so that process becomes completely automated by having github actions and semantic release."
